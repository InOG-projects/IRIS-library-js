# IRIS - JS Library

IRIS stands for "Integration of Remote systems into Infection control Software" and is intended to be the central point of mediation between the various contact, event and guest tracking apps on the one hand and the infection control software (e.g. SORMAS) in the health departments on the other.

This repository is used as a client library to handle the connection with the IRIS gateway
